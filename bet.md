This sequence diagram shows the complete lifecycle of a prediction market from bet placement to final rewards distribution. Here are the key phases:

üéØ Bet Placement: User interaction with frontend, validation, and fund locking in smart contract

üìä Market Monitoring: Continuous AI-driven odds updates and real-time data processing

‚è∞ Resolution Trigger: Automatic market closure and initiation of outcome verification

üîç Oracle Data Collection: Multi-source data aggregation for outcome determination

ü§ñ AI Verification: Confidence-based outcome verification with fallback to manual review

üí∞ Payout Distribution: Automated winner calculation and fund distribution

üèÜ NFT Rewards: Dynamic NFT minting and evolution based on user achievements

üìà Social Updates: Leaderboard recalculation and social feature updates

Key Features Highlighted:

Error handling with AI confidence thresholds
Multi-source verification for market resolution
Dynamic NFT rewards based on user performance
Real-time updates throughout the process
Social gamification elements
Database persistence for user history and analytics
The diagram shows how your SocialFi approach integrates seamlessly - users get immediate feedback, social updates, and gamified rewards while maintaining the security of on-chain settlement.

Would you like me to create additional diagrams for specific subsystems (AI agent interactions, NFT evolution mechanics, or the swipe interface flow)?

Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation of how prediction resolution, oracle integration, and outcome confirmation should work after the user places a bet:

Post-Bet Prediction Lifecycle
User places bet: Funds get locked in the smart contract.
Market resolution period begins: Market remains open for bets until the deadline.
Market closes: At the event conclusion, outcome resolution is triggered.
Oracle Integration Options
The oracle is the backbone for resolving outcomes. There are three primary approaches:

1. Decentralized Oracles (e.g., Chainlink, Witnet, Supra, Band)
How it works: Chainlink nodes (or similar) fetch off-chain data about the event outcome and push it on-chain via a consensus mechanism.
Pros:
Trustless, highly secure if well-designed.
Broad adoption and documentation.
Can support custom adapters for unique data sources (sports, crypto prices, election results).
Cons:
Higher cost (node fees per request).
Somewhat slow for exotic markets (may require custom development).
Not all oracles support every event type natively‚Äîyou might need to run your own node.
2. Custom/Hybrid Oracles + AI Verification
How it works: You fetch event data from multiple trusted sources off-chain (API feeds, official results), aggregate, and resolve outcomes through a combination of automated AI verification and, if needed, human/manual review for disputes.
Pros:
Maximally flexible (supports ANY type of event anywhere).
AI can handle data aggregation, source reliability, and "confidence scoring". If AI is ‚â• threshold (say, 95% confidence), outcome posts automatically.
Lower cost for frequent, niche, or community-driven events.
Cons:
Requires extra backend: must reliably fetch, aggregate, and sign results.
Requires staking or slashing mechanism for validator reliability.
Needs human intervention in ambiguous/disputed cases.
3. Community/DAO Resolution (Aragon, Reality.eth, Kleros)
How it works: After the event, the community or a DAO votes on the outcome (sometimes combined with economic incentives/slashing of malicious actors).
Pros:
Decentralized for all event types.
Incentivizes honest reporting (slashing penalties for bad actors).
Can combine with NFT-based governance/token voting.
Cons:
Slower resolutions (depends on voting delay).
Possible risk of collusion or apathy (no-shows).
More complex UX for mainstream users.
Hybrid Approach Recommendation
For your use-case (SocialFi, mobile-first, diverse events), a hybrid model is best.

Use a decentralized oracle (like Chainlink or Supra) for all standard/financial markets (crypto prices, sports from major providers).
Integrate a custom oracle layer with AI verification for long-tail and social/community markets. This backend fetches data, AI verifies, and only escalates to DAO/community/manual review in edge/conflict cases.
Allow for NFT/DAO voting as a fail-safe in rare disputes (especially for social or inside-community bets).
This gives you automation, flexibility, and a fully on-chain, composable record for security and trust.
Example Resolution Flow
Smart contract calls oracle for the outcome: For major events, hits Chainlink or similar.
For unique/social markets: Your backend fetches results from multiple APIs, AI cross-verifies, and submits outcome to contract if confident enough.
If confidence is low/conflict: Smart contract pauses, triggers DAO/community resolution (NFT governance or token-weighted voting).
Once resolved: Smart contract distributes winnings, updates NFT achievements, recalculates leaderboards, etc.
Summary Table

Oracle Model	Pros	Cons	Best For
Decentralized	Highly secure, trustless	Expensive, less flexible	Mainstream/financial/sports
AI-Powered Custom	Flexible, scalable	Needs backend, semi-trusted	Social, niche, or innovative markets
DAO/Community	Decentralized, robust	Slower, possible collusion	Disputes, social/gamified event closure
This hybrid system allows you to scale across verticals (DeFi, social, fun non-financial predictions) while remaining fast, reliable, and truly decentralized.
