I've created a detailed architecture diagram of the user onboarding flow for your prediction market app, reflecting a mobile-first, SocialFi-oriented UX. This flow captures wallet connection (Privy), category/interests onboarding, a Tinder-style swipe interface for personalized predictions, and smooth progression into the core app.

Here’s an overview of the total architecture and tech stack:

1. Frontend (Next.js + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui)
Mobile-first responsive UI
Swiping interface for predictions (Tinder-style)
Custom components with shadcn/ui for consistency
Wallet connection via Privy
Profile, leaderboard, onboarding, and analytics pages
2. User Authentication & Session
Privy for seamless wallet integration (self-custody and social logins)
JWT/session for off-chain interactions (optional)
3. Backend/API (Node.js)
Express/Next.js API routes for business logic (market fetching, swipes, bet placements)
User onboarding logic: store interests, preferences, session state
AI integration APIs: fetch predictions, odds, analytics, NFT logic
Leaderboard calculations and reward logic
4. Database (Prisma ORM)
User profiles (wallet, preferences, onboarding status)
Prediction metadata
Bet history & outcomes
NFT and AI agent ownership/tracking
Leaderboards and social graphs
5. Smart Contract Layer (Solidity, deployed to Core)
Market creation/settlement
Bet management (handle funds, track positions)
NFT minting and evolution
AI agent staking/integration hooks
6. Oracle and AI Service
Decentralized oracle(s) for event outcomes
Off-chain AI module: calculates odds, surfaces personalized market recs, generates NFT visuals
AI agent APIs for user automation
7. NFT Subsystem
Evolving NFTs for user reputation, status, and achievements
NFT-gated features (premium markets, rewards, avatars)
8. Notification/Realtime Layer
Socket.io/service for push alerts: bet results, new markets, leaderboard changes
Onboarding Flow (User Journey Highlights):

App launch → Privy wallet connect
New user: guided through category/interests selection
Enter swipe interface, see relevant predictions side-by-side, swipe left/right for engagement (bet, skip, add to watchlist, get more AI insights)
Lean, rewarding profile setup (username, avatar—including AI-generated or NFT-based, notification preferences)
Land on main dashboard: personal feed, trending predictions, AI-recommended actions, easy switching across categories
Social & gamified features (share, compete, leaderboard, friends’ activity, achievement NFT drops)
Extras:

Guest mode onboarding with prompts to connect wallet for full access
Error handling for wallet issues, retries, skip options
Extended onboarding/tutorial for deeper feature exploration (AI, NFT, SocialFi features)
Let me know if you want:

A deeper deep-dive into the smart contract or AI integration structure
A database schema suggestion (with Prisma models)
Wireframes for specific sections (onboarding, swipe, leaderboard)
User stories for dev planning
